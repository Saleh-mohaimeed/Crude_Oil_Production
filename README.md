# Crude Oil Production Analysis Dashboard

The objective of this project is to employ Selenium and Pandas libraries to extract data from a given URL, specifically focusing on Crude Oil production data categorized by Year, Month, and Country. Once the data extraction is complete, the next step involves building an interactive dashboard using the Dash and Plotly Python packages.

```
This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Usage
1. Run the Flask server:
